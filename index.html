<p>TwoSet Violin – founded in 2014 by Australian duo Brett Yang and Eddy Chen – first went viral with their funny and sometimes painfully accurate videos depicting life as a classical musician.

In 2017, TwoSet Violin created an off-screen fictional character by the name of Ling Ling to represent the unattainably perfect violinist who practices 40 hours a day, in addition to performing impossible tasks related to the violin. In an interview with Yle Uutiset, they describe Ling Ling as a main boss of a video game, a Chuck Norris of violin players. Eddy Chen said they improvised the character from their comedy sketch video where a teenage violin student's tiger mom talks about how her friend's child practices 40 hours a day. In 2018, they released a series of videos called the Ling Ling Workout. In these series, the duo draws a classical piece (or contemporary music), and a playing "handicap" such as double speed, with a string tuned oddly, dancing or hula hooping while playing, with hand positions reversed, or while upside down. Prominent violinists such as Ray Chen, Ziyu He, and Hilary Hahn have also attempted the challenge.
